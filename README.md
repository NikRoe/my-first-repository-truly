# My first day on GitHub 

Today I learned that version control is an **essential** part of my career as _web developer_. 
Some keywords that I should remember for later are:
- git,
- GitHub,
- version control,
- repository,
- commit,
- hash.

 > The next 3 months will be a very exciting time, as I will learn new things every day.
